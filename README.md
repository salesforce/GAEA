## Prerequisites

### Software
Install dependencies by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The code was tested on 
```
cuda 11.2
tensorflow-gpu==2.6.0
keras==2.6.0
```

### Hardware
We ran on a Quadro GV100 with 32GB RAM. 

### Dataset 
1. Dataset merging public census, school, and transportation datasets for the city of Chicago is provided under data/{demographics | network | schools}
2. For Facebook100 dataset download the data as described in http://sociograph.blogspot.com/2011/03/facebook100-data-and-parser-for-it.html and place the unziped data under data/facebook100


## Experiments

Edit repository path and the output path for the project in paths_inc.py .

The run_experiments.py generates all results for: 

1. Original graph 
2. Baseline method
3. Proposed method

On each of the outputted graphs, we run monte carlo weighted walk simulations and estimate the distribution of expected rewards of walkers. On this distribution, we evaluate our main two criteria:

1. Expected Utility
2. Gini Index of Expected Utility

### Graph editing on Chicago school network
```python run_experiments.py --exp edit --graph chicago```

### Graph editing on Facebook100 schools
```python run_experiments.py --exp edit --graph fb --school Caltech36```

Other school network we tried are: Mich67 and Reed98 

### Graph editing on synthetic network
```python run_experiments.py --exp edit --graph synthetic```

### Facility Placement
```python run_experiments.py --exp facility_placement --graph chicago```
